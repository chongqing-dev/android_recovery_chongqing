# 📖 About

This is a fully fixed and cleaned TWRP 12.1 device tree for the **Realme 11 Series** based on the **MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ (MT6835)** platform.

The tree was heavily reworked to properly support:
- Android 14 vendor base
- FBE v2 decryption
- Virtual A/B
- KeyMint 2.0
- modern vendor_boot implementations
- logical partition handling

A lot of broken MT6983 leftovers, invalid fstab entries, and incorrect Keymaster implementations were removed and rebuilt properly for MT6835.

Result:
- stable booting
- fully working decryption
- proper mounting
- clean recovery environment
